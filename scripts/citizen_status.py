"""
Citizen-app reliability contract for the sensor pipeline.

consumer/consumer.py already guarantees delivery: no reading gets lost
between producer and MongoDB. That's a different guarantee from what a
citizen app actually needs, though. The newest stored reading can still
be an unreliable description of *current* conditions for two reasons:

1. Nothing recent has arrived (plain message age, the obvious case).
   With the default FALLBACK_MODE=offline (producer/producer.py) a
   failed sensor keeps sending explicit offline records. They carry no
   values and are ignored here, so the last real reading simply ages.
2. Something arrives on schedule, but it's fake. With
   FALLBACK_MODE=simulate, the producer keeps publishing synthetic values
   with fresh timestamps so an offline demo keeps running. Checking
   message age alone would call a broken sensor "fine" indefinitely,
   since the synthetic data's timestamp is current.

get_all_station_statuses() classifies each station into one of three
states, each with an advisory message the app is expected to show:

- "ok"          a real (source="api") reading, fresh enough to trust
- "stale"       a real reading exists but is older than STALE_AFTER_SECONDS
- "unavailable" nothing recent has arrived, or the station has been
                running on the fallback simulator longer than
                SIMULATED_GRACE_SECONDS with no real reading in between

The optional `risk_profile` argument ("standard", default, or
"vulnerable") controls how fast these fire. "A bit older, use with
caution" might be a fine label for the general public, but it's not
necessarily an acceptable basis for a health-sensitive person deciding
whether it's safe to go outside. "vulnerable" halves the thresholds and,
once a reading counts as stale, switches the advisory from a passive age
label to actively recommending against relying on it.

Intended users in Wilhelmsburg (see producer/stations.json):

- A care service coordinating home visits for elderly clients in the
  Kirchdorf-Sued high-rise estate (station-02). On hot days they call
  clients and schedule extra visits; a wrong "all clear" costs more
  than a missing value, so they use --risk-profile vulnerable.
- A shift supervisor at a tank terminal on the Hohe Schaar (station-03)
  who stops outdoor work above the terminal's gust limit. A stale or
  simulated gust value is worse than none here, because it makes a stop
  decision look covered by data.
- Residents and commuters deciding whether to cycle across the Elbe
  bridges or let children play outside: standard profile, a slightly
  older reading is fine if labelled with its age.

Run from the host (requires `pip install pymongo`) while
`docker compose up` is running:
