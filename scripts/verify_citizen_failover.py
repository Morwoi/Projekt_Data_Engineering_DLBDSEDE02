"""
Checks that the citizen-app reliability contract (citizen_status.py)
actually catches a real sensor outage, not just that the logic looks
correct on paper.

Forces the producer's Open-Meteo request timeout to ~0
(API_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=0.001, see docker-compose.yml), so every API call
fails immediately and the producer's existing fallback path takes over -
the same code path a real outage would trigger, without needing any
firewall/network manipulation. Then it polls the live contract and prints
a timestamped transcript of every status transition, and restores the
normal timeout afterwards to confirm the status returns to "ok".

Requires the stack to already be running (`docker compose up -d`) and the
`docker` CLI on PATH.
