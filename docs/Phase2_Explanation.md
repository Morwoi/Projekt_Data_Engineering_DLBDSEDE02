# Explanation: Implementation of the Stream Processing Pipeline

GitHub repository: [https://github.com/Morwoi/Projekt-Data-Engineering-DLBDSEDE02](https://github.com/Morwoi/Projekt_Data_Engineering_DLBDSEDE02)

## Implementation

The repository contains a containerized pipeline that streams simulated
municipal sensor data into MongoDB via Kafka. Kafka runs in single node
KRaft mode and MongoDB runs as an official container, both wired
together with health checks in docker-compose.yml. A Python producer
polls the Open-Meteo API for five simulated stations every 10 seconds
and publishes each reading as JSON to the sensor-readings topic. When
an API call fails, the producer switches to a local simulator that
generates a plausible reading from the last known value and tags it as
simulated, so the stream keeps running through a real outage instead
of stalling. This fallback exists only because Open-Meteo stands in
for sensor hardware that is not installed yet. It would not be
appropriate with genuine sensors, where a real failure should be
reported honestly as offline instead of being papered over with a
synthesized value.

A Python consumer reads the topic and writes each reading into MongoDB
as an idempotent upsert keyed on station and timestamp, committing
Kafka offsets only after a successful write. Writes that fail are
retried with backoff, and a message that exhausts all retries is
parked in a dead letter collection instead of being dropped. Raw
readings expire after a configurable retention period through a
MongoDB TTL index.

Five scripts on top of the pipeline implement the actual query and
reliability behaviour a planner and a citizen app would need.
planner_queries.py rolls raw readings up into daily per station
statistics computed from real readings only, with a coverage figure
showing how much of a day rests on real measurements rather than
fallback data. citizen_status.py classifies each station as ok, stale
or unavailable based on the age of the last real reading rather than
the last reading overall, since the fallback simulator alone would
make a broken sensor look fine. check_status.py gives a quick host
side health check, and materialize_daily_stats.py persists the daily
aggregation past the raw data retention window. verify_citizen_failover.py
forces a real outage against the running stack and confirms the status
contract actually flips to unavailable and back, instead of assuming
the logic is correct on paper.

Running docker compose up --build starts Kafka, MongoDB, the producer
and the consumer, and the pipeline begins storing readings
automatically with no manual setup steps needed. Full architecture and
usage instructions are in the repository's README.

## Feedback

The feedback on phase 1 was that the two user types were sketched too
superficially and that Kafka's delivery guarantee alone does not say
what a planner or a citizen actually needs from the data day to day.
This was addressed with the query and reliability scripts above rather
than more description, and the phase 1 user story was corrected to
match.
